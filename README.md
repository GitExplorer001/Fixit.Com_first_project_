This is my fully working website. It's an website for a smartphone repairing shop. 
There are 2 parts in this page.
Customer End: Here customers can file their queries about their broken devices that needs to be fixed, They can also track the status of their order simply by entering their phone number or they can contact the shop owner.
Owner End: Here the shop owner can see all the queries, he can sort them by device model, customer name, etc. He can also search stuffs. Secondly he can mark the quaries as accepted or rejected or completed. He can also view the queries in detail and get stuff like the customer address.


The Admin protion is fully made by me (from design to programming). The customer end was designed by the co owner of the project and the PHP programming for the customer end was done by me.
